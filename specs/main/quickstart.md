# Quickstart: Module-2 - Gazebo & Unity Simulations

## Overview
Module-2 of the AI/Spec-Driven Book covers The Digital Twin with Gazebo & Unity simulations, including physics simulation, environments, and sensors. This module is already implemented and ready to use.

## Accessing Module-2 Content

### Navigation
The Module-2 content is accessible through the Docusaurus documentation sidebar:
1. Open the documentation site
2. Navigate to "Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)"
3. Access the three chapters in sequence or individually

### Chapter Structure
Module-2 consists of three comprehensive chapters:

1. **Chapter 1: Physics Simulation with Gazebo**
   - Introduction to Gazebo physics simulation
   - Installation and setup procedures
   - Robot model creation with SDF
   - Physics parameters and configuration

2. **Chapter 2: Digital Twins & HRI in Unity**
   - Creating digital twins in Unity
   - Human-robot interaction (HRI) systems
   - Unity physics and sensor simulation
   - Integration with real robots

3. **Chapter 3: Sensor Simulation & Validation**
   - Sensor types and simulation techniques
   - Implementation in both Gazebo and Unity
   - Validation methodologies
   - Cross-platform validation approaches

## Using the Content

### For Students
- Start with Chapter 1 to understand physics simulation fundamentals
- Progress through each chapter sequentially for comprehensive understanding
- Use the practical code examples to implement your own simulations
- Apply validation techniques from Chapter 3 to ensure accuracy

### For Educators
- Each chapter can be used as standalone content or as part of a sequence
- Code examples can be adapted for classroom demonstrations
- Validation techniques can be used for assessment criteria
- Cross-platform approaches support diverse learning environments

## Technical Requirements

### Gazebo Environment
- ROS/ROS2 installation for full functionality
- Appropriate Gazebo version compatible with your ROS distribution
- SDF model creation tools

### Unity Environment
- Unity Hub and Editor LTS version
- Robotics packages (ROS# connector, Perception, ML-Agents)
- Appropriate system requirements for 3D rendering

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of robotics concepts
- Familiarity with simulation environments
- Knowledge of documentation navigation in Docusaurus

## Next Steps
After completing Module-2, students will be able to:
- Create physics-based simulations in Gazebo
- Build digital twin environments in Unity
- Implement sensor simulation across platforms
- Validate simulation accuracy against real-world data
