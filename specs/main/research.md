# Research: Module-2 Docusaurus Setup for Gazebo & Unity Simulations

## Status: ALREADY IMPLEMENTED

Upon investigation of the codebase, I discovered that Module-2 with the requested content has already been implemented in the Docusaurus documentation structure.

## Research Findings

### 1. Current Implementation Status
- **Module 2 exists**: `docs/module-2/` directory with three chapters
- **Content complete**: Physics simulation, Unity environments, and sensor simulation
- **Navigation integrated**: Properly configured in `my-website/website/sidebars.ts`
- **File format correct**: All content written as .md files as required

### 2. Files Already Created
- `docs/module-2/chapter-1.md`: Physics Simulation with Gazebo
- `docs/module-2/chapter-2.md`: Digital Twins & HRI in Unity
- `docs/module-2/chapter-3.md`: Sensor Simulation & Validation
- `my-website/website/sidebars.ts`: Updated with Module 2 navigation

### 3. Content Coverage Analysis
The existing Module 2 comprehensively covers:
1. **Physics Simulation**: Gazebo physics, setup, and configuration
2. **Environments**: Unity digital twins, HRI, and scene creation
3. **Sensors**: Sensor simulation in both Gazebo and Unity with validation

### 4. Technical Implementation Details
- Each chapter follows proper Docusaurus markdown format with frontmatter
- Chapters include practical code examples in both SDF/XML and C#
- Navigation properly structured in sidebar categories
- Cross-platform validation techniques implemented

### 5. Compliance with Requirements
- ✅ Structured chapters for Gazebo & Unity simulations
- ✅ Physics simulation content covered in Chapter 1
- ✅ Environment creation covered in Chapter 2 (Unity digital twins)
- ✅ Sensor simulation and validation covered in Chapter 3
- ✅ All content written as .md files
- ✅ Organized per chapter for easy navigation
- ✅ Integrated into Docusaurus navigation system

## Decision
No additional implementation is required as the requested Module-2 with structured chapters for Gazebo & Unity simulations (physics, environments, sensors) has already been completed and properly integrated into the Docusaurus documentation system.

## Rationale
The existing implementation fully satisfies the requirements specified in the user request. All three chapters are properly created with relevant content covering physics simulation with Gazebo, digital twin environments with Unity, and sensor simulation techniques with validation methodologies.

## Alternatives Considered
- Creating new implementation: Not necessary since complete implementation already exists
- Modifying existing implementation: Not required as current implementation meets all requirements
- Validating current implementation: Completed and confirmed to meet requirements
