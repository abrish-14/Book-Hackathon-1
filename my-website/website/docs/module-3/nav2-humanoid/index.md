# Nav2 Path Planning for Humanoid Robots

The Navigation 2 (Nav2) stack provides a comprehensive framework for robot navigation in ROS2. This documentation focuses on adapting Nav2 for humanoid robots, which have unique path planning requirements due to their bipedal locomotion and complex kinematics.

## Key Features

- **Path Planning Algorithms**: Advanced algorithms for finding optimal paths
- **Humanoid-Specific Navigation**: Custom controllers for bipedal locomotion
- **Obstacle Avoidance**: Real-time obstacle detection and avoidance
- **ROS2 Integration**: Full integration with the ROS2 ecosystem
- **Simulation Support**: Integration with simulation tools for testing

## Use Cases

- Navigation planning for humanoid robots
- Path optimization for bipedal locomotion
- Obstacle avoidance in complex environments
- Integration with perception systems for autonomous navigation

## Next Steps
