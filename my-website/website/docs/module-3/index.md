# AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™) Documentation

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for the AI-Robot Brain module, covering NVIDIA's Isaac ecosystem technologies for robotics development.

## About This Module

This documentation module provides comprehensive guidance on leveraging NVIDIA Isaac technologies for robotics applications:

- **NVIDIA Isaac Sim**: For photorealistic simulation and synthetic data generation
- **Isaac ROS**: For Visual SLAM and navigation capabilities
- **Nav2**: For path planning, especially for humanoid robots

## Getting Started

Choose a technology to begin exploring:

- [NVIDIA Isaac Sim](./isaac-sim/) - Learn about photorealistic simulation
- [Isaac ROS](./isaac-ros/) - Explore VSLAM and navigation
- [Nav2 Path Planning](./nav2-humanoid/) - Understand path planning for humanoid robots

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of robotics concepts
- Familiarity with ROS/ROS2 (for Isaac ROS and Nav2 sections)
- Understanding of simulation environments (for Isaac Sim section)

## Navigation

Use the sidebar to navigate between different sections of the documentation. Each technology is covered in its own chapter with dedicated tutorials and examples.

## Chapter Connections

### Sequential Learning Path
1. [NVIDIA Isaac Sim](./isaac-sim/) - Start with simulation and synthetic data generation
2. [Isaac ROS](./isaac-ros/) - Learn about perception and navigation with ROS
3. [Nav2 Path Planning](./nav2-humanoid/) - Master path planning for humanoid robots

### Cross-Chapter Integration
- Isaac Sim can generate training data for Isaac ROS perception systems
- Isaac ROS perception can feed into Nav2 navigation systems
- Nav2 path planning can be validated in Isaac Sim environments
