# Prompt History Record

## PROMPT_TEXT

Set up Module-2 in Docusaurus with structured chapters for Gazebo & Unity simulations (physics, environments, sensors).

-All content written as .md files, organized per chapter for easy navigation.

## RESPONSE_TEXT

Module-2 for Docusaurus with structured chapters for Gazebo & Unity simulations has already been implemented. The implementation includes:

- Three chapters in docs/module-2/ as .md files:
  - chapter-1.md: Physics Simulation with Gazebo
  - chapter-2.md: Digital Twins & HRI in Unity
  - chapter-3.md: Sensor Simulation & Validation

- Navigation properly configured in my-website/website/sidebars.ts
- Content covers physics simulation, environments, and sensors as requested
- Files organized per chapter for easy navigation

Created the following planning artifacts:
- specs/main/plan.md: Implementation plan
- specs/main/research.md: Research findings
- specs/main/data-model.md: Data model
- specs/main/quickstart.md: Quickstart guide
- Updated CLAUDE.md with new technology context

## OUTCOME

Successfully discovered that the requested Module-2 implementation was already completed. Created appropriate planning documentation to record this finding and updated the agent context with the technology stack information.

## EVALUATION

The planning task was completed successfully by identifying that the requested feature was already implemented and creating proper documentation to record this status. All required artifacts were created according to the planning workflow.
